## Overview

This section includes links for working with GitHub and advice on how to collaborate in teams on coding projects.

## On GitHub

In this course, you will be working on a [project](project.html) in teams. Because of this, you probably want to be able to share code and work on different parts of the project simultaneously. This is where Git and GitHub comes in. 

[GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} is a way to work on projects and keep track of their status easily and efficiently. It is built off of [Git](https://git-scm.com/){target="_blank"}, a type of [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control){target="_blank"} software. It is super useful and powerful, but people also find it quite annoying and [difficult to understand](https://xkcd.com/1597/){target="_blank"}. So, in an effort to help you, we have collected some resources to learn about GitHub and how you can use it to work on projects.

## Getting Started

What's GitHub? Start here.

- [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/){target="_blank"}: GitHub's take on the "Hello World" program. Great starting point to learn how GitHub works.
- [Github Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides){target="_blank"}: This YouTube Channel has a lot of info about what GitHub can do. The first line of the opening video is, "Okay. You signed up for GitHub.  What do you do now?". If you are asking that very question, this channel will serve you well.

## Getting Help

If you're lost, these might help.

- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/){target="_blank"}: This is a phenomenal collection of short articles from GitHub to help you learn about the fundamentals around their product. They are so great, we have already listed their Hello World article. Here are some other important ones:
    - [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/){target="_blank"}: Explains how working with GitHub generally goes.
    - [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/){target="_blank"}: Explains what version control is.
- [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/){target="_blank"}: This is the yellow-pages of GitHub. Ask a question and it will try to *push* you in the right direction. [Get it?](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/6e7f4795-b65b-4fad-b1fb-c5c9161a95fa){target="_blank"}

## Going Deeper

For the [nerds in the room](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/64bbb001-ed8a-450a-8826-b939f653b969){target="_blank"}...

- [Git For Ages 4 And Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m7BgIvC-uQ){target="_blank"}: There's a lot going on under the hood. This talk will help explain how it all works...with kids toys!
- [Make pretty git logs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1057564/pretty-git-branch-graphs){target="_blank"}: Always remember [(A DOG)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ElVkf.jpg){target="_blank"}. Also, this alias command is nice to have around:
    - `git config --global alias.adog "log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"`
- [`add` and `commit` with one command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4298960/git-add-and-commit-in-one-command){target="_blank"}: Another (even more) helpful alias command:
    - `git config --global alias.add-commit '!git add -A && git commit'`
- [Git Aware Prompt](https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt){target="_blank"}: An excellent add-on to the Terminal that informs you which branch you have checked out. Someone also made [an even spiffier version](https://github.com/udondan/git-aware-prompt){target="_blank"} where it will inform you of your git status using helpful emojis.
